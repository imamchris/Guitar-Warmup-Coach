<h1>Guitar Warmup Coach</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Guitar Warmup Coach Git Repo! <br> In here, are all the various assets required to run and use the Guitar Warmup Coach App!</p>

<h2>What is our Goal?</h2>

<p>Our main goal is to create an application which can generate basic warmup exercises for guitarists of varying levels! <br> 
  This can be a player which is either ust starting out, or somone who is more experienced and might be struggling to figure out the best way to warm up before their usual practice routine.
We provide users with a basic routines which cover scales, arpeggios and chords, allowing for users to expand on simple guitar theory and technical skills which is vital in understanding the guitar</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>You may be curious on how the application functions, so here's how it works...<br>
First of all when a user enters into an exercise they are able to give a rating on a scale 1-10 on how difficult they found a pattern (i.e. G Minor Pentatonic) <br>
This rating is then put into a large database which is then consolidated in the generation of future exercises in order to allow for a user to get the most out of their experience.</p>
