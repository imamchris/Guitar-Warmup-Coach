<h1>Guitar Warmup Coach</h1>

<div class="container">

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What is our Goal?</h2>
    <p>
      Our main goal is to create an application which can generate basic warmup exercises for guitarists of varying levels!
      This can be a player who is either just starting out, or someone more experienced and struggling to figure out the best way to warm up.
      We provide users with basic routines that cover scales, arpeggios, and chords—allowing them to expand on guitar theory and technical skills.
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>You may be curious on how the application functions, so here's how it works...<br>
    First of all when a user enters into an exercise they are able to give a rating on a scale 1-10 on how difficult they found a pattern (i.e. G Minor Pentatonic) <br>
    This rating is then put into a large database which is then consolidated in the generation of future exercises in order to allow for a user to get the most out of their experience.</p>

    <h2>Author Details</h2>
    <p>
      I have played the guitar for many years and often struggled with warming up effectively. This inspired me to create this app
      as part of my Year 12 Software Engineering Major Work—to solve a real problem in a field I’m passionate about.
