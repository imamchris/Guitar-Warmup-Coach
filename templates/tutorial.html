            <h2>1. Reading Guitar TAB</h2>
            <p>
                Guitar TAB (tablature) is a simple way to read music for guitar. Each line represents a string, and numbers show which fret to play.
            </p>
            <div style="max-width: 600px; margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 50px;">
                {{ scale_svg|safe }}
            </div>
            <ul>
                <p>The bottom line is the low E string; the top is the high e string.</p>
                <p>Numbers show which fret to press. A "0" means play the open string.</p>
                <p>Read from left to right for the order of notes.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Reading Chord Charts</h2>
            <p>
                Chord charts show you where to place your fingers to play a chord.
            </p>
            <div style="max-width:220px; margin-bottom:12px; padding-left: 230px;">
                {{ chord_svg|safe }}
            </div>
            <ul>
                <p>Vertical lines = strings (leftmost is low E, rightmost is high e).</p>
                <p>Horizontal lines = frets.</p>
                <p>Black dots = where to place your fingers. Numbers may show which finger to use.</p>
                <p>"O" above a string = play open. "X" = don't play that string.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>3. Reading Chord Progressions</h2>
            <p>
                A chord progression is a sequence of chords played in order. For example:
            </p>
            <div style="font-size:1.2em; margin: 12px 0; font-weight:bold;">
                G &nbsp; / &nbsp; C &nbsp; / &nbsp; D &nbsp; / &nbsp; G
            </div>
            <ul>
                <p>Each chord is played for a set number of beats or bars.</p>
                <p>Slashes (/) separate the chords.</p>
                <p>Repeat the progression as needed for the song or rhythm.</p>
            </ul>
